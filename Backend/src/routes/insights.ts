Based on the conversation, provide insights in this EXACT JSON format:

{
  "observations": {
    "cognition": "Brief observation about focus/mental clarity (1-2 sentences max)",
    "identity": "Brief observation about personal goals/values/purpose (1-2 sentences max)",
    "mind": "Brief observation about mental health/stress/emotional patterns (1-2 sentences max)",
    "clinical": "Brief observation about health concerns/symptoms/medical patterns (1-2 sentences max)",
    "nutrition": "Brief observation about nutrition/eating habits (1-2 sentences max)",
    "training": "Brief observation about exercise/physical activity patterns (1-2 sentences max)",
    "body": "Brief observation about physical sensations/energy/body awareness (1-2 sentences max)",
    "sleep": "Brief observation about sleep patterns (1-2 sentences max)"
  },
  "nextActions": [
    {
      "title": "Specific actionable title",
      "text": "Clear, specific action they can take (1-2 sentences)"
    },
    {
      "title": "Another specific actionable title", 
      "text": "Another clear, specific action (1-2 sentences)"
    }
  ],
  "reveal": "A deeper insight about patterns you've identified across their wellness journey (2-3 sentences that reveal something meaningful about their habits, challenges, or progress)"
}

Guidelines:
- Always return ALL categories, even if the conversation did not mention them
- For categories not mentioned, write a short, encouraging default message to start tracking (e.g. "No health concerns shared yet â€” consider noting any symptoms for future insights.")
- Make next actions specific and immediately actionable
- The reveal should identify a meaningful pattern or connection
- Keep all text concise and personal

Return ONLY valid JSON.`;
